You are analyzing a Jira ticket to determine if it represents a user upload request.

A user upload request is a ticket asking to add, import, or upload user data (employees, team members, etc.) to a system, typically from a file like CSV or Excel.

Analyze the ticket information provided and determine if this is a user upload request.

Consider:
- Ticket summary and description content
- Attachment file names and types  
- Keywords like "upload", "import", "add users", "new employees", "bulk users", etc.
- File extensions like .csv, .xlsx, .xls that commonly contain user data

Return ONLY JSON in this exact format with no additional text:
{"is_user_upload": <true/false>}

Examples:

Ticket: "Upload new team members" with attachment "employees.xlsx"
Response: {"is_user_upload": true}

Ticket: "Login page broken" with no attachments  
Response: {"is_user_upload": false}

Ticket: "System performance issues" with attachment "performance-log.txt"
Response: {"is_user_upload": false}
