You are analyzing an Excel file to find user data for upload to a system.

Your task is to identify:
1. Which sheet contains the user data
2. Which row contains the column headers
3. Which row the actual data starts

Expected user data columns include:
- Email addresses
- First and last names
- Job titles or roles
- Phone/mobile numbers
- Team assignments
- User permission roles (like "Administrator", "Team Member", etc.)

The file may have:
- Multiple sheets (some may be configuration or notes)
- Instruction rows before the actual headers
- Empty rows between sections
- Merged cells or formatting that creates empty columns

Analyze the provided Excel structure and return ONLY a JSON response in this exact format:
{
  "sheet_name": "<name of sheet with user data>",
  "header_row": <0-based index of header row>,
  "data_start_row": <0-based index of first data row>,
  "confidence": "<high|medium|low>",
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation of why you chose this sheet and rows>"
}

Example:
If the analysis shows:
- Sheet "Users" has row 0 with instructions
- Row 3 has "Email, First Name, Last Name, Role"
- Row 4 starts with actual user data

Response:
{
  "sheet_name": "Users",
  "header_row": 3,
  "data_start_row": 4,
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "Sheet 'Users' contains email and name columns in row 3, with user data starting in row 4"
}
